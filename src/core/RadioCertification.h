// Transmit bring-up instrument: drive the whole transmit chain against the
// radio itself and report what every stage actually did.
//
// THIS IS A DIAGNOSTIC, NOT A CERTIFICATION. It deliberately does not return
// pass/fail. Thresholds that are meaningful for one radio are guesses for the
// next, and a tool that says PASS on a radio nobody has characterised is worse
// than one that says "forward power 3846 counts, mic peak -32 dBFS, sideband
// consistent". Judgement stays with the operator or the agent reading it; this
// gathers the evidence they would otherwise gather by hand over several days.
//
// It assumes NO simulator and no second receiver — everything here runs against
// one radio, because that is the situation a new backend starts in.
//
// WHAT IT IS BUILT FROM. Every stage exists because something in the
// Hermes-Lite 2 bring-up failed silently at exactly that point. The stage list
// is a transcription of docs/HERMES.md section 14, and each result carries the
// reference so a future agent lands on the write-up rather than re-deriving it:
//
//   - four separate defects each produced a correct-looking keyed transmission
//     with ZERO forward power (14.1)
//   - a modulator with 85 dB opposite-sideband suppression radiated double
//     sideband, because the quadrature filter was all-pass in magnitude (14.2)
//   - keying reached the radio from the automation bridge and not from the MOX
//     button, because they drive different models (14.5)
//   - transmit ran on the WRONG SIDEBAND while every internal instrument agreed
//     it was right (14.6)
//
// The last one shapes the design. A convention error is invisible to any check
// that shares the convention, so the sideband stage demodulates our own
// transmission rather than looking at the panadapter: the panadapter reads raw
// wire order and agrees with the transmitter by construction, while the
// demodulator applies the receive conjugation and WDSP's sideband selection
// independently. That is a genuinely different path — though still not as
// strong as an unrelated receiver, which is why the report ends with the manual
// checks a human must still perform.
