    //      because it is the object that saw the reply. The shipping
    //      hl2b5up_main gateware reports 4; the skimmer variants report 9-12 and
    //      have no transmitter at all. Never hardcoded — oracle §1.
    //   3. What the LINK can carry at this sample rate. Four receivers at
    //      384 kHz is ~89 Mbit/s on 100BASE-T, which does not fail cleanly: the
    //      link drops packets, and a dropped EP6 packet is a simultaneous gap in
    //      every panadapter.
    //
    // CONNECT ALWAYS COMES UP WITH ONE. Receivers are added afterwards, by the
    // operator, through "Add Panadapter" — createPanadapter() below. That is
    // where the intent actually is, and it means a radio never starts spending
    // link budget and WDSP channels on receivers nobody asked for.
    //
    // The persisted count is gone as the way in. It required editing settings to
    // get a second receiver, made the connect path the only place the count

// Above and below that, +/-20 dB linear in dB — 0.4 dB per slider step, which is
// fine enough to set by ear and wide enough to cover the range between a headset
// boom mic and a built-in laptop microphone.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT BUY depends on which path the audio took, because
// the ALC sits right behind this and is one-sided for client-leveled audio
// (#4796).
//
// MIC PATH: the ALC normalizes each block's peak to alcTargetPeak, so raising
// mic gain on already-loud speech is largely given back and PEP barely moves.
// Where it MATTERS is the ALC's hold threshold (alcHoldBelowDbfs, -45 dBFS):
// below that the ALC deliberately stops lifting, so a microphone quiet enough to
// sit under it gets no makeup at all and goes out weak. This slider is what
// carries such a mic over the threshold — which is exactly what setKeying()'s
// "raise mic gain" diagnostic tells the operator to do, and until that
// diagnostic existed the advice pointed at a control that did nothing here.
//
// CLIENT-LEVELED PATH (TCI/DAX): nothing is given back. The ALC may only reduce,
// never lift, so this is a straight proportional attenuator all the way up to
// alcTargetPeak — TX gain 5 is a real -18 dB on the air. The hold threshold does
// not apply, and neither does the "raise mic gain" diagnostic, which setKeying()
// gates off for such transmissions. Past the target the ALC limits rather than
// letting the modulator's clamp flat-top the signal, so the last stretch of
// travel buys reduced headroom rather than more power.
//
// Level 0 mutes outright rather than resolving to -20 dB. A slider at the bottom
// of its travel means off, and a mic that is merely 20 dB down would still be
// hauled back up by the ALC's 40 dB of makeup — so without the special case,
// "0" would sound barely different from "50".
