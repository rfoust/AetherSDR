// HPSDR Protocol 1 ("Metis") wire primitives for the Hermes-Lite 2 backend.
//
// Direct C++ port of the live-validated tools/hl2/hpsdr.py spike (aetherd
// HL2 Phase 1a). Protocol facts (register map, EP2/EP6 framing, LNA gain
// register) are grounded clean-room in openHPSDR Protocol 1, the Hermes-Lite 2
// wiki/gateware, and the pihpsdr reference client (Principle I; see
// THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES). Where a fact is HL2-specific it has been checked
// against the Hermes-Lite 2 gateware RTL, which is the authority for what this
// hardware actually decodes.
//
// This layer is intentionally socket-free and Qt-free so it unit-tests against
// captured/synthetic frames without hardware; MetisClient owns the UDP socket
// and RX thread and calls into these functions.
//
// TRANSMIT: this layer CAN now encode a keyed frame. The old invariant here —
// "every C0 register-address byte is even, so MOX (C0 bit 0) is always 0, so
// these primitives cannot key the radio" — no longer holds, and pretending
// otherwise would be worse than losing it.
//
// What replaces it is a gate one level up: MetisClient will not set MOX unless
// transmit has been explicitly enabled, and hl2_tx_gate_test asserts that with
// the gate off NO emitted frame ever carries C0 bit 0. The encoders below are
// pure functions; encoding a keyed frame is not the same as sending one.

//
// It lives in this header, beside the curve it is derived from, so EVERY

// disagreeing about the same radio because only one of them had the guard.
//
// ---- why not 16 (#4578, nigelfenton's half), and how 96 was first reached ----
//
// 16 was a guess about where noise stops, and it is too low by six times. A TX
// Cal sweep aborted on its first step at a reported SWR of 256.00 on an antenna
// a RigExpert AA-170 and a real carrier both measured at 1.50 — a LIVE reading,
// admitted by this gate, computed from counts barely above it. Every layer's
// absent-handling worked; the number itself was admitted and wrong.
//
// CRITERION, because there is no single correct answer and the choice has to be
// arguable: one count of quantisation on EITHER channel must not move the
// reported SWR by more than 0.25 — half the finest distinction anything
// downstream makes (1.5 against 2.0 against 2.5, and the 3.0 at which a sweep
// aborts) — for every true SWR from 1.0 to 3.0. Above 3.0 the exact value stops
// mattering because every consumer has already stopped.
//
// Swept against directionalWatts()'s own curve, worst case over that band:
//
//     forward counts    16     32     64     96    128    256    512
//     worst SWR error  0.85   0.50   0.30   0.20   0.16   0.10   0.05
//
// 96 is the smallest count at and above which the criterion holds UNDER THE
// ONE-COUNT MODEL. That model was subsequently measured and found wrong; the
// paragraph beginning "and then it WAS measured" below carries the correction
// and the value this constant actually holds. The sweep is kept because it is
// still the right arithmetic for the question it asks, and because the two
// derivations agreeing where they overlap is what makes the correction
// credible rather than a second opinion.
//
// NOT ~1200, which #4578 suggested. Gating on FORWARD counts does nothing to
// lift the REVERSE channel out of the knee: at a true 1.5 the reverse sits a
// factor of five below forward in voltage, so getting it above 1200 counts
// needs about 16 W forward — past the top of this table and past what an HL2
// produces. At 1200 forward counts a true 2.0 still displayed 1.76 under the
// old raw ratio. It buys nothing and costs SWR below ~0.67 W.
//
// ---- and then it WAS measured, and 96 was too low (bench run D89) ----
//
// The paragraph that used to end this comment said 96 was derived analytically,
// that it assumed a ONE-COUNT channel-to-channel disagreement nobody had put an
// instrument on, and that if the real disagreement were larger then 96 was
// still too low. That measurement has now been made, on a Hermes-Lite 2 into a
// dummy load, reading fwd_pwr and rev_pwr straight out of the response
// registers with no client application in the path. The prediction was right
// and the direction was the unfavourable one.
//
// TWO THINGS WERE MEASURED THAT THE ONE-COUNT MODEL CANNOT EXPRESS.
//
// (1) NOISE, and it is not one count. With RF in the load the reverse channel
//     has a standard deviation of 2.73 counts and a full range of 0..12 counts
//     (2311 settled samples over 15 drive levels). It does not shrink at low
//     drive, because it does not come from the signal: with the PA keyed and
//     the drive register at zero the same channel reads 0.67, and unkeyed it
//     reads 0.63..0.70 (6418 samples over 300 s). The forward channel's
//     residual standard deviation is 3.77 counts.
//
// (2) OFFSET, which is not noise at all and which the criterion above has no
//     term for. Fitting the reverse channel against the forward one across 16
//     legs spanning 1.3 to 822 forward counts gives
//
//         rev = 3.41 + 0.00097 * fwd        (residual sd 0.21 counts)
//
//     so with NO reflected power the reverse channel still reads ~3.4 counts.
//     That is a bias. Averaging does not remove it and a gate does not remove
//     it either — a gate only shrinks its weight against a growing forward
//     reading. The intercept was stable to 0.05 counts across seven captures
//     over forty minutes and is identical keyed and unkeyed, so it is the
//     converter and not the PA.
//
// WHAT THAT DOES TO THE READING. On a dummy load the true answer is known and
// near 1.0, so every departure IS the instrument. At 96 forward counts this
// radio's reverse channel is ~97% offset, and the linearized form reports
//
//     gate 96 -> 1.40      gate 160 -> 1.25      gate 320 -> 1.14
//
// against a load measured at 1.03..1.06 by the same instrument where it is
// trustworthy. 0.40 of error at 96 counts is 1.6x the 0.25 the criterion above
// was chosen to hold, and the empirical settling curve agrees: pooling every
// keyed sample and binning by forward count, the linearized median first comes
// within 0.25 of the truth in the 200..260 bin and its 95th percentile in the
// 260..340 bin.
//
// SO THE CRITERION IS UNCHANGED AND ITS ANSWER MOVED. Re-derived by resampling
// the MEASURED distributions rather than perturbing by an assumed count:
//
//     forward counts        16     32     64     96    160    256    320
//     p95 error (measured) 6.35   1.95   0.91   0.65   0.38   0.26   0.20
//     p95 error (1-count)  1.57   0.50   0.30   0.20    ...    ...   ...
//
// The second row is the old model and is reproduced exactly by the new tool
// where the two overlap, which is why the first row is a correction and not a
// disagreement. 320 is the smallest gridded count whose 95th-percentile error
// stays within 0.25 everywhere above it. 256 misses by 0.008 and is a
// defensible round alternative; 160 is the answer if the criterion is read at
// the MEDIAN rather than as the worst case its wording states.
//
// THE COST, which is the real argument against going further: SWR reads absent
// below ~74 mW forward on the reference curve, 1.5% of the HL2's rated 5 W and
// 18 dB down, against ~12 mW at 96 and ~1.6 mW at 16.
//
// STILL NOT MEASURED, and it bounds what the above is worth: this is ONE radio,
// one coupler and one dummy load. The offset is a per-unit property of a diode
// detector and there is no reason to expect 3.4 counts on another board — only
// to expect that it is not zero, which is the part the one-count model got
// wrong. A per-unit calibration would replace this constant along with the
// curve. See also kMeasuredReverseFloorCounts below, which the test uses to run
// the offset criterion rather than restate it.
//
// A BETTER FIX THAN A GATE EXISTS AND IS NOT DONE HERE. Both channels are
// readable while unkeyed and their floors are stable, so sampling them just
// before a transmission and subtracting would remove the bias outright. On the
// measured distributions that drops the gate this criterion needs from 320 to
// 200 at the 95th percentile and from 160 to 16 at the median. It is a larger
// change than raising a constant, it needs a place to hold the floor and a
// policy for when to re-measure it, and it is recorded rather than attempted.
