// SSB transmit chain for the Hermes-Lite 2: processed TX audio in, baseband IQ
// out, ready for EP2.
//
// The audio arrives already shaped — AudioEngine's TX chain has applied the test
// tone, compressor and EQ before we see it — so this stage is only modulation.
// That is deliberate: it means the TONE button, the microphone and any future
// source all reach the air through ONE path, and what the operator monitors is
// what gets transmitted.
//
// RATES. AudioEngine runs at 24 kHz; EP2 is clocked at a fixed 48 kHz
// regardless of the RX sample rate. WDSP's three-rate channel model does the
// interpolation, which is the same mechanism the RX side uses in the opposite
// direction rather than a second, hand-rolled resampler.
//
// MODULATION is a phasing SSB modulator built here rather than WDSP's TXA
// chain. WDSP's transmit path WORKS — wdsp_channel_test proves it — but driven
// from this backend's configuration it returned underruns and zeros, and the
// failure mode is silent. See the long note in the .cpp.
//
// The output is CONJUGATED for the HPSDR wire, which has the opposite handedness
// to the standard analytic convention. Omitting that transmitted every signal on
// the wrong sideband.

    //
    // THE CONTRACT IS ONE-SIDED, and its two halves are different claims:
    //
    //   * The CLIENT owns its level upward. Nothing here adds gain it did not
    //     ask for — the ALC's makeup half is ceilinged at unity for such
    //     blocks. That half is #4796: an ALC exists to close the 20-30 dB gap
    //     between a microphone and full modulation, and applied to a client
    //     that sets its own level it does the opposite of what either party
    //     wants — it normalizes the client's level control away above the hold
    //     threshold, and freezes into a path-dependent gain below it.
    //   * The MODULATOR owns its own ceiling. Reduction still applies, because
    //     that half was never the bug. m_micGain reaches 10x (+20 dB), so a
    //     full-scale client with the TX gain slider up arrives well inside the
    //     hard clamp in processAudioBlock, and flat-topping an SSB modulator
    //     input splatters across the band. That clamp is a backstop, not a
    //     level control, and must not become the only thing standing between a
    //     hot client and the air.

    // The hold (alcHoldBelowDbfs) belongs to the makeup half and so applies to
    // the mic path only. Leaving it on this path would strand a client-leveled
    // over at whatever reduction its loudest block called for — #4796
    // mirrored. hl2_txdsp_test pins all three of these claims.
