// Owns a MetisClient (UDP wire) and an Hl2RxDsp (demod + panadapter) and maps the
// neutral seam verbs/signals onto them. This is the first backend that owns an
// engine-side DSP chain (RFC §5.5) rather than decoding a cooked stream.
//
// THIS BACKEND CAN KEY THE RADIO. capabilities().canTransmit reports transmit
// AVAILABILITY rather than a constant false: an interactive run may transmit,
// and an automation run defers to the bridge's own TX gate. MetisClient refuses
// independently at the wire, so neither gate is trusted as the only one.
//
// The wire and both DSP chains run on a dedicated I/O thread. That is not only
// about keeping WDSP off the UI: this backend paces EP2, and the gateware
// watchdog halts the stream if EP2 stops arriving.
